      Hi! My name is <strong>Jevone Cyrille G. Abinal</strong>, I’m 19 years old, and I live in Masbate City. I was born and raised here,
      and I can proudly say that being a Masbateño is a big part of who I am. The culture, the people, and the life here shaped
      my character and taught me the values I carry today. Growing up in Masbate wasn’t always easy, but it made me strong and
      determined. I learned the importance of family, perseverance, and hard work in reaching my dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      These values continue to guide me, especially now as I work toward finishing my degree in Information Technology. One of my
      biggest motivations in life is my girlfriend, Angelica. We’ve been together for five years now, and we’re still growing stronger.
      We share the same dream: to finish our studies, build a better future together, and one day have a happy family of our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 19, I know there’s still a long road ahead. I may not have all the answers, but with Angelica by my side and the lessons I’ve
      learned as a proud Masbateño, I’m confident we’ll make it. I believe that even coming from a small city, we can dream big, work
      hard, and achieve something truly meaningful — not just for ourselves, but for the people we love.
